# CameraChameleon
A wireframe of a web-based app that helps first time camera buyers discover what are the most important features for them and find the best products based on those features.

As part of this project, we made a home page using Weebly that can be accessed here: http://camerachameleon2.weebly.com

The wireframe is a .vp file made in Just In Mind. It is called "Final Prototype B.vp" because we made 2 versions of the app (version A and B) for A/B testing. The version B was favoured more by users, hence I have uploaded only the version B file. 
(For a quick demo, refer the "Camera Chameleon.pptx" file)

The presentation showcasing our user research journey is uploaded as "Camera Chameleon.pptx" giving a static demo and a sense of the app's flow. The intructions in the "Notes" gives more context of each screen's capability. 


##Problem:
In the last one week, have you asked Google to find “the best” #insert blank# for you? Chances are, you have. Nowadays, we heavily rely on the internet to find answer to every question we have – be it the best restaurant in town, the best phone is the market, even the best song! And everyone has their own style of doing research – some want an answer right away and some can spend hours scrounging the different websites, finding the best deals, comparing similar products/services etc.

The question of why and how people do research online intrigued me. I knew from personal experience that doing research online is a complex and often tedious and time consuming process; people around me felt the same. So my team and I started a journey to identify the goals and pain-points of conducting an online research and find a way of improving the overall user experience!

##Process:
Because most of us often work in agile environments with short sprints, we followed a lean and agile process of product design and development while also incorporating sufficient UX research to keep the design user-centric and to ensure that the design is informed more with user needs rather than engineering constraints. The reason we did this is because we had established a proof-of-concept earlier with a working prototype in Review Digest and knew that this product is technically possible; the challenge was to understand the user needs and find ways to solve them in the most effective way possible.

The project timeline can be seen on page#3 of "Camera Chameleon.pptx", during the medium-fidelity testing, we realized that our prototype didn’t meet the requirements set by the persona as a result of which we had a major pivot (both in the persona and prototype) in between that I will explain more later on.

####Minimum Viable Problem:
A series of interviews with 15 people in the age range of 25-45 made us realize the people mostly conduct online research when looking to buy expensive, complex and unfamiliar products like a car or a camera! The conduct this research because which product and features are best fit for them. As expected, few of the pain points  experienced was information overload while comparing different products and different sources of information (websites, blogs, tables etc.) which gives rise to the inherent complexity and tediousness of the research process.

In order to scope down the project, we decided to build an digital product/service to help first time camera buyers discover what are the most important features for them and find the best products based on those features.

####Pivot:
We captured the needs of our target users in a persona. As explained before, we did make a major pivot in our persona as well. A glimpse of which can be seen on page#3 of "Camera Chameleon.pptx". Our earlier persona was about a user who enjoyed research. However, mid-way we realized that such an avid researcher would never restrict himself/herself to one source of truth. Hence, we decided to pivot to a user who doesn’t have time to do an extensive research but would like to ensure that they do enough research to ensure they have the right product; such a user would be more concerned with making the process efficient and effective and more likely to use a one-stop shop.

####Process Flow:
The flow can be seen on page#11 of "Camera Chameleon.pptx".
Based on our user research, we decided to build a mobile app that would ask users to select the type of photographs they would take in a fun-interactive way. An underlying machine-learning algorithm would analyze these user input and come up with top 5 features they should consider in their camera. Next the user will enter their price range that would again help the algorithm to identify the top 5 cameras that fit the user’s requirements and pocket. 

The cameras would be displayed in a descending order of the ratings they have got (from Amazon users reviews and professional reviews from CNet, blogs etc.) for every feature. The user can review these ratings by reading the underlying professional as well as reviews. For quick and objective comparison, the Amazon user reviews are compressed in a visual way as displayed in Review Digest. The user also had the option to mail these results and ratings to an email address for later peruse.

####Usability Testing and Advertising:
Usability testing, A/B testing and click testing of the medium-fidelity prototype helped us refine our prototype of our app and landing page (to download the app) further. For example, the result page had a lot of “buttons” that confused user. So we simplified the design to include minimal number of buttons.

We also did a marketing campaign using Google AdWords and tracked the campaign using Google Analytics to identify which campaign appealed most to users. 

##Impact:
Despite pivoting halfway through the design process, my team and I were able to design a product from end-to-end that improved online research user experience. Because of our lean/agile methodology, we were able to rapidly evolve the product and test out the different concepts, workflows and designed that tackled the root cause of problems faced by users. Our product was very received well by not only people from the course but also various experienced designer and researchers who had offered to be mentors in our course.
