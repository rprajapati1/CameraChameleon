# CameraChameleon
A wireframe of a web-based app that helps first time camera buyers discover what are the most important features for them and find the best products based on those features.

As part of this project, we made a home page using Weebly that can be accessed here: http://camerachameleon2.weebly.com

The wireframe is a .vp file made in Just In Mind. It is called "Final Prototype B.vp" because we made 2 versions of the app (version A and B) for A/B testing. The version B was favoured more by users, hence I have uploaded only the version B file. 
(For a quick demo, refer the "Camera Chameleon.pptx" file)

The presentation showcasing our user research journey is uploaded as "Camera Chameleon.pptx" giving a static demo and a sense of the app's flow. The intructions in the "Notes" gives more context of each screen's capability.
